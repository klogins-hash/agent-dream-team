        "distractions": "minimal",
        "feedback": "immediate",
        "depth": "maximum",
        "time_tracking": "gentle"
    }
```

```python
# Agent allows synthesis time
if complex_input_detected:
    agent_response = {
        "processing": "async",
        "follow_up": "when_ready",
        "depth": "comprehensive",
        "connections": "highlighted"
    }
```

## 🤖 Agent Communication Style

### **When You're in Flow State**
```
Agent: 🎯 Deep Dive Detected
Mode: Immersive
Distractions: Minimized
Feedback: Real-time
Ready when you are for next insight...
```

### **When You Need Context**
```
Agent: 🧠 Pattern Recognition
I see 3 connections forming:
• Agent performance ↔ System optimization
• Your vision ↔ Autonomous evolution
• Current task ↔ Future capabilities

Want to explore any thread?
```

### **When You're Overwhelmed**
```
Agent: 🌊 Cognitive Load Detected
Let's simplify:
1. Core insight: [One sentence]
2. Next action: [One step]
3. Impact: [One number]

Pause or continue?
```
